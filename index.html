                    <h1>Bhagat Singh Shaheed-e-Azam</h1>
                    <p>Bhagat Singh was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who
                        participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be
                        retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist He later took part in a largely symbolic
                        bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the
                        back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the
                        Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern
                        India Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism he electrified a growing militancy
                        in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's
                        nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence. <br><br><br>

                        In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small
                        revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot
                        dead a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today
                        Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police
                        superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate They held Scott
                        responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
                        ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart
                        attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet
                        fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at
                        close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable,
                        Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.
